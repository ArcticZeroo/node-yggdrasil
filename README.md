# yggdrasil
[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/zekesonxx/node-yggdrasil.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/zekesonxx/node-yggdrasil)

A Node.js client for doing requests to yggdrasil, the Mojang authentication system.
There's already one other client out there (at the time of writing) but I don't like it, so I wrote this one.

# Usage
    $ npm install yggdrasil

Right now you basically need to look through the source to do anything. Soon it'll be documented well and have examples, but it doesn't yet.
